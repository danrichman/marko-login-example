#### This is a work in progress (Help Wanted)

Would like to put a Marko Widgets registration form together where the inputs have individual valid/invalid states and the form itself also has a valid/invalid states. Not entirely sure how to put this together, but Iâ€™d think this is something a lot of people would need to start a project and would love the help if anyone is interested.
